Buy my things
=============

A tiny HTML template to sell your things.

Basic formatting
----------------

Just use basic HTML to format your page. Use `<img/>` and `<p></p>` to display your items.

Display your sold items
-----------------------

To display the items you’ve sold, use the following markup:

<ul class="sold">
	<li><img src="foo.png"/></li>
</ul>

License
-------

I don't know anything about licensing, so I'll just write it how I would say it in real-life: you can do whatever the hell you want with this, but it’d be great if you contributed to this GitHub.
